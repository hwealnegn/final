This is my final project for Web Development (Summer 2015) in the Masters Program in Computer Science at the University of Chicago.

My project is a shared blog - a space for a group of people to share their online findings with each other. My friends and I often share links to interesting articles with each other, but the links get lost in our inboxes or various messaging platforms and are difficult to dig up or find again. With this "idea exchange" platform, everything we share is archived in one place.

I have deployed my project though Heroku: https://peaceful-garden-6694.herokuapp.com/
